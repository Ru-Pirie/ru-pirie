## About Me
Heyo, my name is Rubens. I'm a computer science and engineering student currently studying at college in my second year. I wish to go onto the aerospace sector or something within the field. Recently I really got into programming and learnt JavaScript which I'm pretty happy with. Recently I have decided to start learning C, due to it being the most common language used in the mission critical area. Can't wait to go into college and crack down on those pesky life skills

### Some facts about me:
1. I've been programming seriously for about three and a bit years!
2. I love meeting new people
3. I love a good challenge and am open to people approaching me with stuff they need doing
4. Have done some commissioned projects working for a company in America which has unfortunately gone under
5. Iâ€™m open to any challenge and will look forward to one put to me

## My Future
These are some of my future goals and things which I want to do!
- [x] Learn C#
- [x] Get better with Web Tech
- [x] Learn JavaScript
- [x] Learn Basic Kotlin
- [x] Get started on a proper project
- [ ] Finish that project...
- [x] Setup my own [website](https://ru-pirie.com) with portfolio and stuff

## Languages I Know
 - Proficient in c#
 - Proficient in Python
 - Advanced in JavaScript to a level I could teach it to another
 - Beginner TS
 - HTML, the basics
 - Good 'ol SQL

## My Projects
1. The first real widely used project that I have worked on was a bot to schedule notifications to help some friends out during the pandemic. The code is in no way nice or clean; it was just something which I wrote in a day.
2. The next thing that I worked on was a very basic app which I wish to expand upon in the near future! This was written in Katlin and was nice to stretch my legs and try out a different language.
3. My website which has gone through various iterations and will soon hopefully enter its final form.
4. A discord bot with Minecraft integration for [@The-Cookie-Factory](https://github.com/The-Cookie-Factory) for more information contact me directly.
5. A customer service and status bot which integrated into various IOT solutions such as googles API and Minecraft. A good challenge! Source code for this will become available soon once the project is decommissioned fully. If you really want to have a look, email me.
> FYI: Quite a lot of my stuff is closed-source due to them being unclean and quick little projects and some due to the fact that they are custom projects and the owners do not wish for the source code to become public
