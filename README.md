## About Me
Heyo, my name is Rubens i'm a computer science and engernering student currently studying at secondary school in my final year. I wish to go onto the Aerospace sector or something to do with that sorta thing. Recently I realy got into programming and learnt JavaScript which im pretty happy with now and have now decided to start learning C due to that being the most common language used in the mission crytical area.

## My Future
These are some of my future goals and things which I want to do!
- [ ] Learn C
- [ ] Learn Kotlin
- [ ] Get started on a proper project
- [ ] Setup my own website with protfolio and stuff

## My Projects
1. The first real widly used project that I have worked on was a noticiation schedular to help some friends out during the pandemic. The code is in no way nice or clean it was just something which I wrote in a day.
2. The next thing that I worked on was a very basic app which I wish to expand apon in the near future! This was writen in kotlin and was nice to streach my legs and try out a different language.
> FYI: Quite allot of my stuff is closed-source due to being realy messy and quick little projects
