## About Me
Heyo, my name is Rubens i'm a computer science and engernering student currently studying at secondary school in my final year. I wish to go onto the Aerospace sector or something to do with that sorta thing. Recently I realy got into programming and learnt JavaScript which im pretty happy with now and have now decided to start learning C due to that being the most common language used in the mission crytical area.

### Some facts about me:
 1. I'v been programming seriously for about 6 months
 2. I love to meet new people
 3. I love a good challenge and am open to people aproaching me with stuff they need doing

## My Future
These are some of my future goals and things which I want to do!
- [ ] Learn C
- [x] Learn JavaScript
- [ ] Learn Kotlin
- [x] Get started on a proper project
- [ ] Finish that project...
- [x] Setup my own [website](https://ru-pirie.com) with protfolio and stuff 

## Languages I Know
 - The basics of Python
 - Proficient in JavaScript to a level I could teach the basics

## My Projects
1. The first real widly used project that I have worked on was a noticiation schedular to help some friends out during the pandemic. The code is in no way nice or clean it was just something which I wrote in a day.
2. The next thing that I worked on was a very basic app which I wish to expand apon in the near future! This was writen in kotlin and was nice to streach my legs and try out a different language.
> FYI: Quite allot of my stuff is closed-source due to being unclean and quick little projects and some due to the fact that they are custom projects and the owners do not wish for the source code to become public
